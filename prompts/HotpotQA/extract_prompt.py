Topic: Heathcote Williams
Text: John Henley Heathcote-Williams (15 November 1941 â€“ 1 July 2017), known as Heathcote Williams, was an English poet, actor, political activist and dramatist.  He wrote a number of book-length polemical poems including "Autogeddon", "Falling for a Dolphin" and "Whale Nation", which in 1988 became, according to Philip Hoare, "the most powerful argument for the newly instigated worldwide ban on whaling." Williams invented his idiosyncratic "documentary/investigative poetry" style which he put to good purpose bringing a diverse range of environmental and political matters to public attention.
